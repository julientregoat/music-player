**work in progress**

a music player + library born out of a desire to enable deeper music classification through user defined properties, and to execute complex queries using these properties.

most of the logic is handled by the `librarian`, a rust library. it will expose a C api which a GUI can call into.

personally, I'm not a fan of iTunes or its replacement, Music. a macos GUI built with Swift is the current priority.
